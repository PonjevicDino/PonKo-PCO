# Personal Protocol - Pervasive Computing - Dino Ponjevic


## Lecture 01 - 26.04.2024:

### Exercise:

#### Welcome
The Workshop-like course "Pervasive Computing" started with a small "get to know each other"-Round,
where we learned about each others experience in connecting sensors/actuators and programming.

After that, we picked a partner to work in a group for the course-project.

#### GIT Setup
We created a GIT repository (this one) for the documentation and the protocols. This includes the
sharing of the repo (with corresponding permissions) and importing the example repo.

#### The Kit
We've got an extensive prototyping kit, which includes four ESP32s, a WiFi Router with OpenWRT, a
RasperryPI, multiple diverse sensors and cables.


## Lecture 02 - 29.04.2024:

### Exercise:
This process is described [here](/Teamfolder/exercises/exercise02/README.md) more detailed.

#### The ESP32
We learned about the features and the possibilites of the ESP32.
The pin layout of the Wemos D1 ESP32 can be found [here](/Teamfolder/pictures/exercise02/ESP).
Furthermore, we talked about bus systems - a short summary of the IPS-System is described 
[here](/Dino/researches/research02/README.md#IPS)

#### Working with LEDs
We started by connecting the ESP32 to a breadboard with a LED respectively. Then, we made sure,
that all cables are connected to the correct pins and we flashed the "Blink-Example" to the ESP32.

After this step was working, we worked with a button to be able to toggle the state of the LED by
a click/press. To accomplish this, we used the DigitalRead and DigitalWrite Methods of the ESP32.
We learned (the hard way), why "INPUT_PULLUP" or "INPUT_PULLDOWN" may be more usefull than just 
"INPUT" - It maps the values inbetween to either the on or the off state.

#### Simple Web Requests
We've extended the provided Server-Example of the ESP32 to provide two additional endpoints -
an "LED-on" and an "LED-off" endpoint. This endpoint than changes the state of the LED if a request
gets sent to it. I.e. by typing "192.168.20.208/on" in the browsers URL bar.

Furthermore, we created an simple "Button-Client" on a second ESP32 and another "Toggle" endpoint.
This button then triggers a request on the second ESP32 which calls the endpoint of the "server".
At the end, we extended that to a third ESP32, so that we had a simple "Flip-Flop" switch. (One
LED, but two individual power switches.)

### Research:

#### IPS
- Developed by Motorola in 1987
- Uses the „Master-Slave“-System:
	- The master device initiates communication and generates the clock signal, while one or more slave devices respond to the master's commands.
	- Clock Signal: periodic signal generated by the master device that synchronizes the transmission and reception of data between the master and slave devices
- Synchronous Communication
	- Data is transmitted and received based on clock signal -> master and slaves must be synchronized to clock signal
- Multi-Connection on:
 	- SLK/CLK: Clock signal, transmitted by the master device.
	- POCI/MISO: Master input – Slave output
	- PICO/MOSI: Master output – Slave input
- Can be “Daisy-chained”
	- Connecting the slaves MOSI to another slaves MISO
- Full duplex (Sending and receiving at the same time)
	- Doubling the data rate, but switching to half duplex, by transmitting both over the MOSI and MISO lines.
- Data Format:
	- no specific data format. Format is determined by devices which communicate over the bus
- Speed
	- SPI can operate at high speeds, making it suitable for applications where high data rates are required.

##### Examples
- Camera Lenses
- Ethernet, USB and CAN
- Flash Memory
	- SPI's high-speed capability is well-suited for quickly reading from or writing to flash memory.
- Real-Time Clocks


## Lecture 03 - 02.05.2024:
This process is described [here](/Teamfolder/exercises/exercise03/README.md) more detailed.

### Exercise:

#### What is MQTT
MQTT enables the transmittion of Telemety-Data over any network, even if the latency is high or the network is congested. MQTT uses
the Ports 1883 and 8883, which are reserved by the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). TLS is optional, but can be used.

The MQTT-Server (called "Broker"), holds the current state of all its clients, therefore it may be used as a simple database. A
typlical client would be a temperature sensor on an actuator.

To call any client, the server has to send the message in a hierarchial way. I.e. "Car/Tyre/FL/Pressure". MQTT uses QOS (Quality
of service), which can show how important any message is.

##### How to stop the MQTT Broker
"/etc/int.d/mqttbroker stop"

#### Use of MQTT
We used the mqttsuite, which we installed on the WiFi Router and we installed "Mosquitto" for
Windows, to be able to push and listen to messages on the MQTT Server. After me made sure that the
messages can be transmitted and recieved correctly via the command line, we changed the
LED-Example from the second lecture, so that it works with MQTT and not with simple HTTP requests.

#### Working with a Raspberry Pi
Then, we downloaded and installed Pi-OS to a Raspberry 4 Kit. This included the initial setup in 
the PI-Manager and installing the updates for the system via a SSH connection and the "apt update"/
"apt upgrade" command.

At the end of this lecture, we installed "Node-RED" to the Raspberry Kit.

##### Game example playtrough
Players: “A” – Hunter | “B” – Hunted player

1.	Player A and B start at a random point and set up the App. This includes the download of the map and the connection to a game instance/lobby.
2.	Both Players now have a 10 Minute countdown, where they can separate from each other. Player A must not follow Player B intentionally. No Positions are shown on each other’s screen. If the LoRaWAN connection gets weak, a warning will be shown. The use of cars/bikes/public transport/etc. is prohibited!
3.	The timer runs out and the game switches to the “running” state. Player A has three “Pings” left. A ping triggers the transmission of the hunters’ position for 20 seconds. This Ping is shown actively to Player B.
4.	Player B founds an NFC Tag and an NFC Reader. By activating the reader, he unlocks the PowerUP “Jammer”. It is stored in the inventory.
5.	Player A pings Player B, but the Jammer PowerUP activates.
6.	The Position for Player B is shown on the Map for all Players, but it jitters in an unplausible way.
7.	Player A founds another PowerUP - “ATC”
8.	Player A triggers a new ping, which shows the current Position of Player B for 20 seconds, but also the moving speed, height and direction of the hunted player. This position will be updated multiple times
9.	Player B enters an indoor area and the connection between the LoRaWAN transmitters will get weak. The Game will transmit both positions internally in the background and perform a distance calculation.
10.	The game calculated that the weak signal results from the walls of the building. It will show a warning to both players – Player B gets a timer and has to leave the building.
11.	Player B does not leave the building in time and Player A sees the last Position with a GPS fix.
12.	Player A enters the same building. As both players do not have a GPS connection, but the LoRaWAN connection is established, the Game switches to the “Indoor-Mode”. Both players can see the others’ signal strength.
13.	Player A founds Player B  Game finished. (Go to Step 1)

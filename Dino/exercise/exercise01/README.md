## Welcome
The Workshop-like course "Pervasive Computing" started with a small "get to know each other"-Round,
where we learned about each others experience in connecting sensors/actuators and programming.

After that, we picked a partner to work in a group for the course-project.

## GIT Setup
We created a GIT repository (this one) for the documentation and the protocols. This includes the
sharing of the repo (with corresponding permissions) and importing the example repo.

## The Kit
We've got an extensive prototyping kit, which includes four ESP32s, a WiFi Router with OpenWRT, a
RasperryPI, multiple diverse sensors and cables.

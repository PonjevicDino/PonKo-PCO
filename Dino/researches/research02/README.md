## Overview
1. [IPS](/Dino/researches/exercise02/README.md#IPS)

## IPS
- Developed by Motorola in 1987
- Uses the „Master-Slave“-System:
	- The master device initiates communication and generates the clock signal, while one or more slave devices respond to the master's commands.
	- Clock Signal: periodic signal generated by the master device that synchronizes the transmission and reception of data between the master and slave devices
- Synchronous Communication
	- Data is transmitted and received based on clock signal -> master and slaves must be synchronized to clock signal
- Multi-Connection on:
 	- SLK/CLK: Clock signal, transmitted by the master device.
	- POCI/MISO: Master input – Slave output
	- PICO/MOSI: Master output – Slave input
- Can be “Daisy-chained”
	- Connecting the slaves MOSI to another slaves MISO
- Full duplex (Sending and receiving at the same time)
	- Doubling the data rate, but switching to half duplex, by transmitting both over the MOSI and MISO lines.
- Data Format:
	- no specific data format. Format is determined by devices which communicate over the bus
- Speed
	- SPI can operate at high speeds, making it suitable for applications where high data rates are required.

### Examples
- Camera Lenses
- Ethernet, USB and CAN
- Flash Memory
	- SPI's high-speed capability is well-suited for quickly reading from or writing to flash memory.
- Real-Time Clocks

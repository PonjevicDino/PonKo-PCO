## Lecture/Exercise 02 - 29.04.2024 - Lab Records:

## Overview
1. [PIN Layout](/Teamfolder/exercises/exercise02/#pin-layout)
2. [Blinking LED](/Teamfolder/exercises/exercise02/#blinking-led)

## PIN Layout
Pin Layout of the Wemos D1 ESP32 can be found [here](/Teamfolder/exercises/exercise02/ESP32-pinout.png) 

## Blinking LED
For this small example we created an Arduino program which makes the onboard LED of the ESP8266 blink every 200 miliseconds.

### How to begin
1. Tools > Board > WEMOS D1 MINI ESP32
2. Files > Example > Built in examples > 01. Basics > Blink
3. Verify the program
4. Added new PIN and PIN-Mode (D3)
5. Switched the LED on and off with the DIGITAL-WRITE command.
6. Upload File to ESP32

### Code for the blinking LED
Here you can find the code for the blinking LED -> [blink.ino](/Teamfolder/exercises/exercise02/Blink/Blink.ino)
